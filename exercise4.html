        <h1>What about us?</h1>
        
        <p>     La da da da da, la da da da da<br>
            Da da da<br>
            We are searchlights, we can see in the dark<br>
            We are rockets, pointed up at the stars<br>
            We are billions of beautiful hearts<br>
            And you sold us down the river too far<br>
            What about us? <br>
            What about all the times you said you had the answers? <br>
            What about us? <br>
            What about all the broken happy ever afters? <br>
            What about us? <br>
            What about all the plans that ended in disaster? <br>
            What about love? What about trust? <br>
            What about us? <br>
            We are problems that want to be solved<br>
            We are children that need to be loved<br>
            We were willin', we came when you called<br>
            But, man, you fooled us, enough is enough, oh<br>
            What about us? <br>
            What about all the times you said you had the answers? <br>
            What about us? <br>
            What about all the broken happy ever afters? <br>
            Oh, what about us? <br>
            What about all the plans that ended in disaster? <br>
            Oh, what about love? What about trust? <br>
            What about us? <br>
            Oh, what about us? <br>
            What about all the plans that ended in disaster? <br>
            What about love? What about trust? <br>
            What about us? <br>
            Sticks and stones, they may break these bones<br>
            But then I'll be ready, are you ready? <br>
            It's the start of us, waking up, come on<br>
            Are you ready? I'll be ready<br>
            I don't want control, I want to let go<br>
            Are you ready? I'll be ready<br>
            'Cause now it's time to let them know<br>
            We are ready, what about us? <br>
            What about us? <br>
            What about all the times you said you had the answers? <br>
            So what about us? <br>
            What about all the broken happy ever afters? <br>
            Oh, what about us? <br>
            What about all the plans that ended in disaster? <br>
            Oh, what about love? What about trust? <br>
            What about us? <br>
            What about us? <br>
            What about us? <br>
            What about us? <br>
            What about us? <br>
            What about us? <br>
            What about us? <br>
